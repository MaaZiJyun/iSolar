LifeStar is a unique application designed to inspire self-improvement, self-monitoring, and self-reflection by offering a profound perspective on the finite nature of human life.

Unlike traditional time or schedule management apps, iSolar doesnâ€™t focus on organizing your tasks or managing your daily routine. Instead, it serves as a gentle but powerful reminder of lifeâ€™s fleeting nature, encouraging users to live more intentionally and meaningfully.

Through a metaphorical representation of human life as a star, the app visually and numerically illustrates how much of your life is behind you and how much remains ahead. Just as a star shines brightly before it fades, LifeStar motivates users to make the most of their remaining time and reflect on how they are living.

## Getting Started

Firstly, download and install MySQL

Secondly, create a database named "Selfware"

Thirdly, create necessary tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `cubes` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `userId` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `date` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `percentage` float NOT NULL,
  `status` enum('OPENING','CLOSED') NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `date` (`date`),
  CONSTRAINT `cubes_chk_1` CHECK (((`percentage` >= 0) and (`percentage` <= 100)))
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=55 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `profile_picture` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `contact` varchar(15) DEFAULT NULL,
  `gender` enum('Male','Female','Other') DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_of_birth` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `bio` text,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=4 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE `tasks` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `user_id` int NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `date` date NOT NULL,
  `remarks` text,
  `completion` enum('0%','50%','100%') DEFAULT '0%',
  `mark` enum('Failure','Pass','Satisfactory','Good','Excellent') DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `user_id` (`user_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `tasks_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `Users` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=44 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use the application.
